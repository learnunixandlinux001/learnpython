1. Downloaded latest Onion Browser Button plugin from chrome.
2. If developer mode is on in Chrome, you can download crx (Use a crx plugin downloader, plenty of such Chrome extension available)
3. Once you download crx, extract it into a folder: 'Onion Browser Button'  (crx is basically a zip file)
4. Inside this folder code, in the file config.js in lib folder, look for app.storage.read("state") and make it ON (This is to turn ON plugin automatically when Chrome starts).
5. Do a pip3 install for the python library 'Undetected Chrome Driver'. Github page for project is https://github.com/ultrafunkamsterdam/undetected-chromedriver
>pip install undetected-chromedriver
This special chromedriver will help Chrome escape the Cloudfare filtering.
6. In your python code, this is the snippet to use:
        chrome_options = uc.ChromeOptions()
        chrome_options.add_argument('--load-extension=D:\\Onion-Browser-Button') //This folder is where you hacked the config.js file and made it 'ON' instead of 'OFF'
        driver = uc.Chrome(options=chrome_options)
7. Note that in the code you execute only one round , instead of infinite loop. So after one task, program exits.
So now, you have to call this program in a loop using a .bat file. Check out the file infinite.bat which Sujith made, available on github learnpython.New python file is sample.py
8. Note that for Onion Browser Button plugin to work, we should also start a standalone TOR process in the background. The code is in the 'standalone-tor-server' folder. Just open a CMD in windows and run the 'run.bat' from inside this folder and choose option 1 - 'Start TOR connection' and leave it running. Only after this, start your program.

Note: Sometimes the TOR network is slow and program will have too many failures.

Note: It stills showing 'Are you Human?' page while browsing thru Udemy. Need to figure out a way to send following options. Is the 'Undetected chromedriver' sending it by default?
Our old program was using conventional Chrome driver, and so we were able to send following options.
THe undetected-chromedriver is throwing an error when we give these options. Need to retry.
 #options.add_experimental_option("excludeSwitches", ["enable-automation"])
 #options.add_experimental_option('useAutomationExtension', False)
 #options.add_argument('no-sandbox')
